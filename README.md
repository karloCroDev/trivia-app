**Tech stack**

 - List item
 - [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) - Next.js is a React framework that enables the building of server-side rendered (SSR) and static web applications. It aims to simplify the development of complex web applications by providing a powerful, feature-rich environment with built-in support for many modern web development concepts and best practices.
 - [Sass (Scss)](https://sass-lang.com/) - is a preprocessor scripting language that is interpreted or compiled into CSS. It allows you to use variables, nested rules, mixins, and functions, making CSS more maintainable and easier to write.
 - [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) - is a strongly typed programming language that builds on JavaScript, giving you better tooling at any scale. It adds static types to JavaScript, which helps in catching errors early during development and improves overall code quality.
 

**Getting started**
 - I hosted the app using vercel, so feel free to check it out  ðŸ‘‰[Kvizardio](https://trivia-app-seven-ruby.vercel.app/)
 - 


This is a [Next.js](https://nextjs.org/) project bootstrapped with [`create-next-app`](https://github.com/vercel/next.js/tree/canary/packages/create-next-app).

## Getting Started

First, run the development server:

```bash
npm run dev
# or
yarn dev
# or
pnpm dev
# or
bun dev
```

Also dom't forget to install all dependencies
```
npm install
#or
npm i 
```
Open [http://localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000) with your browser to see the result.

You can start editing the page by modifying `app/page.tsx`. The page auto-updates as you edit the file.

This project uses [`next/font`](https://nextjs.org/docs/basic-features/font-optimization) to automatically optimize and load Inter, a custom Google Font.

## Deploy on Vercel

The easiest way to deploy your Next.js app is to use the [Vercel Platform](https://vercel.com/new?utm_medium=default-template&filter=next.js&utm_source=create-next-app&utm_campaign=create-next-app-readme) from the creators of Next.js.
